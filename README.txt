Overview
This dataset represents a collection of literature focused on marginal lands, compiled through an informal review conducted by a single author. The goal of this dataset is to provide an organized compilation of studies that examine marginal lands across various regions, land types, crop types, and methodologies. The data includes key metadata that describes the study parameters, findings, and definitions related to marginal land estimation.

Dataset Contents
The dataset consists of the following metadata fields:

ID: A unique identifier assigned to each reviewed paper.
Region: Location category distinguishing between:
- National (US): Studies conducted at a national scale within the United States.
- National (Non-US): Studies conducted at a national scale outside of the United States.
- Sub-national entities: Studies that focus on specific sub-regions or localized areas within a country.
MarginalLand: The estimated area of marginal land reported by the study, in hectares.
Crop Type: A qualitative description of the crop types examined or proposed for use on the marginal lands.
Land Type: A qualitative description of the types of marginal lands analyzed in the study (e.g., abandoned farmland, degraded lands).
AreaReviewed_text: A qualitative description of the geographical area or region reviewed in the study.
AreaReviewed_numeric: The area reviewed by the study in hectares, where quantifiable data is provided.
Definition: The working definition of marginal land used by the study (e.g., abandoned, unproductive, degraded land).
Definition_notes: Notes and observations made by the author regarding the studyâ€™s definition of marginal land.
Method: The method used to determine marginal land, grouped into the following categories:
- Biological: Factors that affect biological yield, including climate, edaphic (soil-related) conditions, crop growing conditions, and other biological factors.
- Economic: Cost-benefit analyses or other economic evaluations of land productivity.
- Social: Observations regarding land abandonment by landowners or other social factors.
- Health: Land contamination or degradation due to prior usage, affecting its suitability for agricultural or other productive uses.
Method_notes: Additional notes by the author regarding the method(s) used in each study.
Other: General notes on the reviewed publications, including observations not captured in other fields.
Citation: The full citation of the manuscript, formatted according to the relevant citation style.
DOI: The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for the manuscript, where available.

Purpose
The dataset aims to provide a resource for researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders interested in marginal lands, offering insights into how various studies define and estimate marginal lands across different regions and contexts. This dataset may be useful for comparative analysis, further study, or for informing the development of policies related to land use and sustainable agriculture.
